    <p> Ozge Akmandor is a PhD candidate at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Niraj K. Jha. She received the BS
        degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Turkey, in 2015, and the
        MA degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, NJ, in 2017. Her research interests lie at the
        intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and Internet-of-Things, with a focus on smart
        healthcare applications. She is the recipient of six Dr. Altay Awards and Princeton University PhD fellowship.
        Her research was featured in a spotlight article in IEEE Computer Magazine and IEEE Transactions on Multiscale
        Computing Systems. Two patent applications have been filed based on her research.</p>

    <p><strong>Research Abstract: Semantically Enhanced Classification of Real-world Tasks </strong></p>
    <p>Traditional approaches use supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to distill intelligence from data and,
        hence, impart smartness to various devices. They try to map the training data to the corresponding labels while
        ensuring generalizability to unseen data. However, they do not take advantage of meaning-based relationships
        among labels in the decision process. Consider a dataset that has a calm sleep, REM sleep and stress situation
        as labels. Current supervised ML algorithms will result in the same data-label model even if we replace the
        labels with class 1,class 2, and class 3. However, calm sleep and REM sleep are semantically more similar, but
        less similar to stress situation. It would be advantageous to exploit this semantic relationship during
        classification. Our framework, called SECRET, addresses the above problem through a dual-space classification
        approach.</p>
